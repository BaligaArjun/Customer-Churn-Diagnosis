Page 1: Customer Churn Overview
This page gives a high-level view of overall customer churn and business health. It shows total customers, total revenue, churned vs active customers, and the overall churn rate. The churn trend over time highlights how cancellations have increased in recent years. The customer status breakdown makes it clear that churned customers form a large share of the base, which signals a serious retention problem. Revenue and profit KPIs help set context on how much churn is impacting the business financially.

Page 2: Churn Drivers and Revenue Risk
This page focuses on why customers are leaving and where the biggest risks are. It breaks down revenue loss by marketing channel, churn reason, city, and product category. The visuals show that certain cities and categories contribute disproportionately to revenue loss. Support-related issues like bad service and low quality are strongly linked to churn, and longer issue resolution times are associated with higher churn risk. This page helps identify operational and customer experience problems that are driving cancellations.
