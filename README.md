Page 3: Retention and Financial Impact Analysis
This page connects churn directly to revenue impact. It shows revenue at risk, average order value, customer lifetime revenue, and loyal customer count. The analysis highlights that churned customers account for a large share of lifetime revenue loss. Sales channel comparison shows that some channels generate higher revenue but also carry higher churn risk. City-level analysis identifies high-risk cities where revenue exposure is the highest, helping prioritize where retention efforts would have the biggest impact.
